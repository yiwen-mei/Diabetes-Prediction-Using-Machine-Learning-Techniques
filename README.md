# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Techniques

## Introduction

This project is aimed at predicting diabetes using machine learning models. The analysis is based on a dataset of diagnostic measurements to build predictive models. 

## Objectives

- Preprocess the dataset to fit machine learning models.
- Utilize models like RandomForest, GradientBoosting, LogisticRegression and Neural Network for prediction.
- Tune the hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- Evaluate model performance and identify patients who may be at risk of having diabetes, which is helpful for developing personalized treatment plans.

## Data Source

The dataset includes diagnostic measurements for diabetes from the `diabetes.csv` dataset. It consists of various features such as 
- Pregnancies: The number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, tensorflow, keras

## Results

The project successfully identifies the most effective predictors of diabetes, evaluates the accuracy of different machine learning models, and is helpful for researchers to explore the medical and demographic features possibly leading to diabetes.
